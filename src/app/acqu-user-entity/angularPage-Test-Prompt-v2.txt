Okay, here's a revised and more structured set of requirements, aiming for clarity and completeness, for the described Java entity and its associated user interface:

1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a user interface (UI) to manage AcquUserEntity records. The UI will provide functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, along with advanced filtering, bulk actions, and auditing capabilities. The interface should be responsive, user-friendly, and visually clear.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 Data Entry Form

Purpose: To allow users to create new AcquUserEntity records and update existing ones.

Elements:

userEntityId: (Hidden field - should be auto-generated or handled by backend)

userName: Text input field.

userEmail: Text input field, requiring a valid email format.

phoneModel: Text input field, requiring uppercase text.

userDescription: HTML editor to allow rich text input.

status:( Hidden field - should be handled by record creation)

createdDate:( Hidden field - should be handled by record creation)

updatedDate:( Hidden field - should be handled by record update)

Validation:

userEmail: Must be a valid email format.

phoneModel: Required and must contain only uppercase text.

All fields except userDescription should be required.

Behavior:

The form should be initially collapsed.

A button labeled "Add New" or "Add Record" should expand the form upon clicking.

After a successful submission (create or update), display a success message in the message/info section.

If there are errors in validation or server issues, display an error message in the message/info section.

Form should allow to update data based on record selected from the data-grid

2.2. Data Grid

Purpose: To display and manage AcquUserEntity records in a tabular format.

Features:

Columns:

Checkbox (for bulk actions)

Details button

userEntityId

userName

userEmail

phoneModel (Editable dropdown, dynamically populated from the backend)

userDescription (Truncated for display, show full text on the detail popup)

status

createdDate

updatedDate

Edit button

Filtering:

Field-Based Filtering: Dropdown to select a field (userName, userEmail, phoneModel, status), dropdown to select operator (like, equal, contains, not equals), text input for the filter value.

Date Range Filtering: Two date/time picker inputs for filtering by createdDate and two for updatedDate.

Sorting: Ability to sort data by clicking on column headers.

Pagination: Implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.

Bulk Status Updates:

Checkbox selection for multiple rows.

Dropdown to select a status ('DELETED', 'FROZEN', 'LIVE', 'TEST').

Button to apply status change to all selected records.

Status Coloring: Display rows with different colors based on the status (e.g., red for 'DELETED', blue for 'FROZEN', green for 'LIVE').

Record Details Popup: A button to view the details of a record in a popup, displaying the full content of userDescription.

Editable Dropdown: User should be able to edit phoneModel directly in table via dynamic dropdown.

Global Search: Global Search text box on top of datagrid to search the record across the fields with button to fire search query.

Message/Info Section: Display messages/info from form, status updates, record deletion, any error messages to the user.

Actions:

Edit Record: A button per row to populate the form with the corresponding record data for editing.

Delete DELETED Records: A button to delete all records with 'DELETED' status, with a confirmation popup.

Export to Excel: A button to export the currently filtered data to an Excel file.

Reload table: Reload all data in the grid and refresh dropdown on data-grid

Behavior:

After bulk status update or record deletion, display a message in the message/info section and refresh data-grid table.

Data-Grid should remember the filters, sorting, and pagination status after any action/reload.

2.3. Backend Interaction

All data fetching, saving, updating, deleting, and filtering should go via backend java controller services

Backend should return success or failure status with message so that UI can display accordingly.

Dropdown value for phoneModel on data grid is coming via java controller services

Export excel file should be coming from java controller services.

Audit trail should be handled by Java backend services

Use code with caution.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling to display user-friendly messages in case of validation errors, server issues, or network problems.

Audit Trail: Maintain a log of all changes to AcquUserEntity records, including who made the changes and when.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles (e.g., only admins can delete records).

Performance: The UI should be responsive and efficient, especially for large datasets. Pagination, backend optimization and efficient data fetching is a must.

Accessibility: The UI should be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines.

Security: Secure data transmission between UI and server, preventing any potential security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

User Experience (UX): Provide a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.

4. Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js or Angular.js or similar

Backend: Java Spring Boot

Database: (The database technology should be determined based on the project context)

UI Library: Material UI or similar is preferable.

Excel Export Library: Use Apache POI library or similar for excel generation from java

5. User Interface (UI) Mockups

UI mockups would need to be designed separately to visualize the functionality and user flow. This would include sketches or wireframes for all sections of the UI.

Key Improvements in this Version:

Clear Separation: Clear distinction between functional and non-functional requirements.

Detailed Descriptions: More precise explanations of each component and behavior.

User-Centric Language: Focus on how the user will interact with the UI.

Explicit Validation: Detailed validation rules.

Backend Interaction Clarity: Clear specification of the need for backend services and their responsibilities.

Non-Functional Emphasis: Addition of performance, security, accessibility, and UX considerations.

Technology Stack Mentioned: Provides a basic tech stack which can be updated to reflect your technology.

This more detailed requirements document will help guide the development process and ensure that the final product meets the desired specifications. Remember to create mockups to finalize visual design.
